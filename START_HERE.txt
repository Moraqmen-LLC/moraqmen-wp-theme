💡 KEY PRINCIPLES
================================================================================

1. FOLLOW THE PLAN EXACTLY
   Don't deviate. Don't skip steps. Don't add features.
   Just follow the plan as written.

2. FOCUS ON HERO BLOCK ONLY
   Not Feature block. Not CTA block. Just Hero.
   Everything else is Phase 2+.

3. QUALITY FIRST
   Lighthouse > 90. Accessibility > 90.
   No shortcuts on quality.

4. DOCUMENT AS YOU GO
   Don't save documentation for later.
   Document while building.

5. WHEN IN DOUBT, READ THE DOCUMENTS
   Every question is answered in docs/4_DAY_SPRINT_PLAN.md
   Find your phase. Follow instructions.
